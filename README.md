# Scrooch 3 Template

Welcome to **Scrooch 3 Template** â€” a ready-to-use modding base for Scratch 3 projects!

## What is this?

Scrooch 3 Template is a **precompiled mod template** based on the `gh-pages` branch of PenguinMod, renamed and customized to be your launchpad for creating advanced Scratch 3 mods.

Unlike traditional Scratch modding that requires building and compiling, this template lets you **edit the source files directly** â€” HTML, JavaScript, and images â€” with no build process needed.

## Who is this for?

- Users comfortable editing web source code (HTML, JS, and image assets)  
- Those who want powerful control over Scratch 3 modding  
- People who want to skip the complicated build tools and workflows

## How to use

1. **Clone or download** this repository.  
2. **Edit** the source files (`index.html`, `js/`, `images/`, etc.) to customize your mod.  
3. **Test** your changes locally by opening `index.html` in a browser.  
4. When ready, **publish your mod** by enabling GitHub Pages in the repo settings and selecting the `main` branch as the source.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and image file handling  
- A GitHub account (recommended) for easy hosting with GitHub Pages  

## Why use Scrooch 3 Template?

- **No build steps!** Work directly with the compiled source.  
- **Fast iteration:** Edit and test changes instantly.  
- **Based on PenguinMod:** A solid Scratch 3 mod foundation trusted by many.  

## Notes

- This template is **not** for Scratch 2 or block-based modding. For easier Scratch 2 mods, consider using Scrooch 2.  
- Keep backups of your edits! Since you work directly on source files, mistakes can happen.
